      <description>Here we describe the necessary steps for deployment.
Please pardon the state of this document as it is a living and breathing set of instructions, and this part of the project has yet to be addressed.
Kubernetes What is it? Why use it? Possibilities &amp;ldquo;Bare Metal&amp;rdquo; What is it? Why use it? Perhaps you have old computers lying around (if at a university, these may be more than enough for a considerable server) and are looking to repurpose them.</description>

      <description>Introduction Let&amp;rsquo;s first get a feel for the possibilities, and see what is possible by checking out some existing websites, organizations, and repositories. The idea of removing installation complexities, platform dependencies, etc. from your end-users is beautifully demonstrated by some of the recent advancements made over at Project Jupyter, all visible on their Github repository
Example My favorite example that demonstrates how slick this new approach to setting up programming environmnents is JupyterLab + Binder.</description>

      <title>Use-Cases</title>

      <description>Here we describe the several use-cases we hope to address within this documentation.
Local Laboratory Here is how one sets up Jupyter on one&amp;rsquo;s own machine (&amp;ldquo;local installation&amp;rdquo;). Since Project Jupyter relies on web frameworks and operates through your browser, the instructions will also apply for installing on a remote server.
The instructions for doing so can be found on the Install Anaconda page.
Classroom Resources You are a teacher with a small-to-medium sized classroom and want to set up a centralized server for your students to have access to notebooks you wrote.</description>

      <description>Here we briefly describe some of the available resources and possible directions this documentation might take.
Most notably, there is Binder, which allows you to recreate an entire environment as-needed in an isolated instance that is destroyed once it is no longer needed. The ideal scenario is to have Binder installed on a server, and we discuss the process of setting up such a server in this documentation, but for now we address setting up an environment on your own computer.</description>
