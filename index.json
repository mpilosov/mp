Group-level events allow cooperation to thrive under unfavorable conditions such as low intra-group assortment and moderate rates of migration, and can greatly speed up the evolution of cooperation when conditions are more favorable. The time-dependent effects of fission and extinction events are studied and illustrated here using a PDE model of a group-structured population based loosely on populations of hunter-gatherer tribes. By solving the PDE numerically we can compare models with and without group- level events, and explicitly calculate quantities associated with dynamics, like how long it takes a small population of cooperators to become a majority, as well as equilibrium population densities.","tags":["biology","evolution"],"title":"Group-level events are catalysts in the evolution of cooperation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461736800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461736800,"objectID":"91dd82e17bf6548e783db919f2f1fae8","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/project/consistentbayes/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/consistentbayes/","section":"project","summary":"A repository I wrote for my PhD research.","tags":["code"],"title":"Consistent Bayes","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Academic makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown.
