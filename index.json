Feel free to use your own.\nAnd one for python2:\nconda create -n py2 python=2.7\nTo remove:\nconda remove --name py2 --all\nWe can now switch between versions of python with commands like\nsource activate py3 and source activate py2 and then source deactivate when you\u0026rsquo;re ready to be done.\nDiving Deeper Widgets Overview:\npip install ipywidgets\njupyter nbextension install --py --user widgetsnbextension\njupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension\nMore information about widgets can be found here\nAlternatively, in each of these environments, run\nconda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets\nwhich will install all sorts of dependencies, including Jupyter notebooks2. It supposedly enables the widgets too but you can run\njupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension to make sure.\npython -m ipykernel install --name py3 --user will then link the kernel to jupyter.\nThen --name py3 flag is optional and just assigns a name of your choosing to that kernel. The version of python used for the kernel is whatever is returned when you ask bash which python (so if you used source activate earlier, it will be the version associated with the kernel whose name is in parentheses in your Terminal session). The --user flag is necessary.\niPyParallel https://github.com/ipython/ipyparallel\npip install ipyparallel to install.\nipcluster nbextension enable (add the --user flag as well if you encounter an error). This one also seems to be necessary to get the clusters to show up:\njupyter serverextension enable --sys-prefix --py ipyparallel\nTo install for all users (as root):\njupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --py ipyparallel jupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix --py ipyparallel  Kernels Introduction TODO: WRITE MORE ABOUT MULTI-KERNEL SUPPORT, provide an example.\nOverview To see all the kernels jupyter is aware of: jupyter kernelspec list\nManagement To remove kernels, use jupyter kernelspec remove\nJupyterHub Introduction More information here about installation would be helpful, but we\u0026rsquo;ll be going through this in more detail at another time since JupyterHub will form the basis for the solutions we will use for our classroom environments.\nInstallation Configuration (for personal use)\nGetting Started\nRunning a notebook server\nJupyterLab Introduction I love this environment but it is a little tricky to set up properly and get everything working as expected. Though once you do, I doubt you will want to use anything else.\nInstall Once Jupyter Lab is installed, go ahead and run it the same way you would a notebook:\njupyter lab (--no-browser)\nWidget Extensions By default (as of Dec 2018), it will be accessible through localhost:8888\nGo ahead and launch an instance of Python and see if widgets work.\nimport ipywidgets as wd wd.FloatSlider()  If the output of the following is text instead of a widget, try running the following in the command-line (shutdown the server with Ctrl-C twice, then\njupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager\nAnd relaunch JupyterLab (if you didn\u0026rsquo;t close your browswer window, a simple refresh will work to re-establish the connection and pick up where you left off), and try the example above again.\nSomething that came up once\nI saw my server output spitting out TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'io_loop' over and over again when any kernel was started. Something was going on with the WebSocket I/O communication (whatever that means), but the following downgrade of the Python Web Framework worked to fix it:\npip install tornado==4.5.3\nSharing Motivation TODO write about why this is useful\nExporting conda env export \u0026gt; environment.yml\nWhich you then load up with conda env create -f environment.yml\nCloning You can make an exact copy of an environment by creating a clone of it:\nconda create --name myclone --clone myenv\nTo verify that the copy was made:\nconda info --envs\n Github Gists are actually surprisingly difficult to sort through, and navigating to this webpage will be much easier, anyway. ^ It does appear though that notebooks is pre-packaged now with Anaconda, so it will likely already be installed. ^   ","date":1545375600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545375600,"objectID":"e2d6d9a479df4a6e68efa7ed94b7874b","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/openscience/anaconda/","publishdate":"2018-12-21T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/openscience/anaconda/","section":"openscience","summary":"These instructions originally appeared on the \u0026ldquo;Resources\u0026rdquo; page of my website, where I link to my Github Gist.

For now, we provide a brief overview and summary of what we are looking into.\nWidgets If you have ever tried developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for your code, you\u0026rsquo;ll know how cumbersome it can be. Thankfully, the Widgets package from Project Jupyter greatly simplifies linking your code to a large library of existing \u0026ldquo;widgets,\u0026rdquo; which do everything from giving you sliders to fully-interactive maps.\nI highly encourage you to see what is possible to embed in your notebooks (and webpages) by scrolling through their examples.\nJupyter nbviewer Paste a link to a notebook into this form and this website will render the notebook for your reading pleasure.\nDocker Github Anaconda BinderHub BinderHub\ntaken from the repository description:\n BinderHub allows you to BUILD and REGISTER a Docker image using a GitHub repository, then CONNECT with JupyterHub, allowing you to create a public IP address that allows users to interact with the code and environment within a live JupyterHub instance. You can select a specific branch name, commit, or tag to serve.\n Repo2Docker repo2docker\nAs the title suggest, this package turns a github repository into a docker image that can be built.\ntaken from the repository description:\n repo2docker fetches a git repository and builds a container image based on the configuration files found in the repository.\n Binder leverages this to then serve the contents of the image in conjuction with JupyterHub.\nKubernetes Google is a provider. Links/info should go here to a couple other platforms, some basic information.\nJupyterHub JupyterHub\ntaken from the repository description:\n With JupyterHub you can create a multi-user Hub which spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook server.\nProject Jupyter created JupyterHub to support many users. The Hub can offer notebook servers to a class of students, a corporate data science workgroup, a scientific research project, or a high performance computing group.\nTechnical overview Three main actors make up JupyterHub:\n multi-user Hub (tornado process) configurable http proxy (node-http-proxy) multiple single-user Jupyter notebook servers (Python/Jupyter/tornado)  Basic principles for operation are:\n Hub launches a proxy. Proxy forwards all requests to Hub by default. Hub handles login, and spawns single-user servers on demand. Hub configures proxy to forward url prefixes to the single-user notebook servers.  JupyterHub also provides a REST API for administration of the Hub and its users.\n I personally run Jupyterhub on a remote server so that I always have access to a secure and familiar environment if I ever need to test out some code and find myself without my laptop. By default, it accepts the login information of just the user who is running it, but we will see later how it can be configured for its intended use as a multi-user authentication hub.\n","date":1545375600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545375600,"objectID":"7a60d3f11ac50872f40feeb46328b4ef","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/openscience/getting-started/","publishdate":"2018-12-21T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/openscience/getting-started/","section":"openscience","summary":"Basics In this documentation, we will research and likely leverage (most if not all of) the following open-source projects.

Created slides and docs based on the exampleSite folder, including creating the directory /assets/css/reveal_custom.css for the Reveal.js slideshows.\n added boards.jpg to /static/img/ to test headers and embeds in the example slideshow. created slides.md in /content/ to link to /content/slides/ folder since using an index file does not work to list the available slideshows in that folder.  created /wid/ and /dockerhub/ to experiment with new docs template.\n copied over dummy project files, still need to migrate own projects to new formatting, remove dummy projects.\n Changed work hyperlink and resume to reflect new migration to the docs template.\n resume widget changed to hyperlink to resume doc.\n  To-Do  header/feature images for post, check how fb/twitter scrapes them.  optional feature image without becoming header will be useful for posts that are galleries.  migrate any posts/projects to new formatting. think about how to migrate MathematicalMichael.\n  Next Steps Things I\u0026rsquo;m Considering\n No need to re-make publication type.  Since posts can be linked to projects, and filters can be applied within widgets, we should have all the flexibility we need. Taken with the new folder structure of pages, the overall directory structure remains quite clean.  Use widgets pagetype to construct/mimick the /artwork page.\n Have carousels and project widgets linking to galleries and slideshows.  Can additionally link out to a docs page that describes the art in more depth, also linked to from the projects page of Probably Art to tell the \u0026ldquo;story\u0026rdquo; of this project over time and in its phases.\n Phase 1: Directed Study Phase 2: Pickup with Pocket CHIP, restart coding in Python Phase 3: After some time, picked it up again and added a whole bunch of functionality, attempted to get random art automated in Squarespace Phase 4: Pick up again when I get into GCode. Adds functionality. Phase 5: Lapse again. Then finally tackle creating a framework that will work long-term. Talk about requirements. How is has to be in Python, based on stable packages, recreatable and deterministic. GCode scalable. Talk about some to-do\u0026rsquo;s (bumpers, bash scripts that wrap around to position plotter better). Show images of getting plotter back up again.\n Phase 6: Merge with Animation code/projects.

New GUI for stacking effects, connecting each effect to the needed time-series based on available entries in aforementioned dictionary. All effects get applied with their time series, passed to animation function to be written to file. Maybe use the Play button to preview? (Have a GUI focused on the num_frames perspective). It is linked to the index.  Notes  Still having trouble with the mybinder.org connections with my giftplanning library that tests out my deployment solutions for interactive blogs.

In theory (as of this writing), the same Docker image can be used with slight modifications, then deleted whenever one chooses to do so.\nInteractive Publishing You wrote a scientific paper, developed most of the code in Python (perhaps using Jupyter Notebooks/Lab), and want to write interactive visualizations for your webpage or some online publication.1\n We hope to address doing this with R or Julia (or any other kernel), but since there are language-specific tools (such as Shiny for R, Dash for Python), we focus on the most directly-applicable use-case for the author, which is to convert ipywidgets embedded in a notebook into embeddable HTML pages. ^   ","date":1545030000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545375600,"objectID":"6e4f38fa8704c205354d8d24d834efa0","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/openscience/usage/","publishdate":"2018-12-17T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/openscience/usage/","section":"openscience","summary":"Here we describe the several use-cases we hope to address within this documentation.\nLocal Laboratory Here is how one sets up Jupyter on one\u0026rsquo;s own machine (\u0026ldquo;local installation\u0026rdquo;). Since Project Jupyter relies on web frameworks and operates through your browser, the instructions will also apply for installing on a remote server.\nThe instructions for doing so can be found on the Install Anaconda page.\nClassroom Resources You are a teacher with a small-to-medium sized classroom and want to set up a centralized server for your students to have access to notebooks you wrote.","tags":null,"title":"Use-Cases","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Here we briefly describe some of the available resources and possible directions this documentation might take.\nMost notably, there is Binder, which allows you to recreate an entire environment as-needed in an isolated instance that is destroyed once it is no longer needed. The ideal scenario is to have Binder installed on a server, and we discuss the process of setting up such a server in this documentation, but for now we address setting up an environment on your own computer.\nWe focus here on Python, and rely on Anaconda deployed on a Linux distribution. Here, we use Ubuntu 18.04, but the instructions should be comparable on previous versions as well as on Mac and Windows, though some of the interactions in the command-line will be different for Windows users.\nHistory (This brief history represents the view of the author of this webpage and may not be completely accurate).\nProject Jupyter is the maturation of the iPython project, a command-line program that allowed for an interactive Python shell, and what I relied on in my early days of learning Python. Their flagship development/breakthrough was the Notebook, which forms the foundation for all the other products.\nThe notebook is an HTML page that is served for you by a jupyter notebook server. It looks and feels like a desktop application. It was undoubtedly inspired by Mathematica\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Notebooks,\u0026rdquo; but released as an open-source project, leading to its rapidly-expanding adoption in the scientific community.\nThe key to understanding why the notebook is so special is that it allows the web-browser to interact with code running on any computer (be it your own or a remote server). By divorcing the computation from the rendering, the developers allow for a unified framework so that scientists can focus on writing code and not on keeping up with dev-ops architecture.\nThe idea is simply that once one adapts to the Jupyter ecosystem, they are freed from platform considerations. Code is shareable across Windows/Mac/Linux, and viewable in the same environment that it was developed in by using a web-browser. It seeks to completely replace IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), which were the best solutions for setting up someone who was new to programming.\nBasically, there was a serious desire to make getting up-and-running with software development easier. Now, thanks to Jupyter, a teacher can set up isolated computing environments for every student and be sure that their experiences are uniform. This is an especially huge time-saver for workshops.\n","date":1544943600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545375600,"objectID":"77aa7862f8cdd88cc524f9d66997cca2","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/openscience/intro/","publishdate":"2018-12-16T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/openscience/intro/","section":"openscience","summary":"Here we briefly describe some of the available resources and possible directions this documentation might take.\nMost notably, there is Binder, which allows you to recreate an entire environment as-needed in an isolated instance that is destroyed once it is no longer needed.

Group-level events allow cooperation to thrive under unfavorable conditions such as low intra-group assortment and moderate rates of migration, and can greatly speed up the evolution of cooperation when conditions are more favorable. The time-dependent effects of fission and extinction events are studied and illustrated here using a PDE model of a group-structured population based loosely on populations of hunter-gatherer tribes. By solving the PDE numerically we can compare models with and without group- level events, and explicitly calculate quantities associated with dynamics, like how long it takes a small population of cooperators to become a majority, as well as equilibrium population densities.","tags":["biology","evolution"],"title":"Group-level events are catalysts in the evolution of cooperation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461736800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461736800,"objectID":"91dd82e17bf6548e783db919f2f1fae8","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/project/consistentbayes/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/consistentbayes/","section":"project","summary":"A repository I wrote for my PhD research.","tags":["code"],"title":"Consistent Bayes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"                                                                                                      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
