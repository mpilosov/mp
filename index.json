Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.\nContainerization is increasingly popular because containers are:\n Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized. Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel. Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly. Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere. Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas. Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.   Images An image is a collection of files (a package) that is executable. It has all the files necessary to run an application, from dependencies to configuration files.\nIt is analogous to a class from object-oriented programming.\nContainers \u0026ldquo;A container is a runtime instance of an image,\u0026rdquo; or in other words, it is an instance of a class. One image can be used to \u0026ldquo;spin up\u0026rdquo; many containers. A container is what an image becomes (in the computer\u0026rsquo;s memory) when it is launched. It is a user process with a state and need for access to resources.\nDocker being a \u0026ldquo;machine\u0026rdquo; of sorts, it has its own processes, which happen to be instances of images\u0026ndash;containers.\nJust as you would in Linux, you can see a list of your running containers by issuing (sudo) docker ps (more on that soon).\nComparison to Virtual Machines  A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. It runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight.\nBy contrast, a virtual machine (VM) runs a full-blown “guest” operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor. In general, VMs provide an environment with more resources than most applications need.\n Here is a Virtual Machine:\nAnd here is a Container:\nNotice how Docker sits atop the Host Operating System 1 and is performing the management role of resources among applications in place of a \u0026ldquo;hypervisor\u0026rdquo; from a Virtual Machine.\nDocumentation Here is the Cheatsheet from which I will be pulling much of what is in this post.\nback to top\nInstall Linux Quick and easy install script provided by Docker:\ncurl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh  From the author of the cheatsheet:\n If you\u0026rsquo;re not willing to run a random shell script, please see the installation instructions for your distribution. If you are a complete Docker newbie, you should follow the series of tutorials now.\n macOS Download and install Docker Community Edition. if you have Homebrew-Cask, just type brew cask install docker.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve installed Docker Community Edition, click the docker icon in Launchpad. Then start up a container:\ndocker run hello-world  Note: You may have to restart your shell session (either by closing and re-launching a new one, or logging out of your remote server connection with Ctrl-D and logging back in with ssh). This is what I had to do.\nIf successful, you should see a \u0026ldquo;Hello from Docker!\u0026rdquo; printout in your console.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it, you have a running Docker container (this one comes with the install).\nHowever, we are not quite done yet. Let\u0026rsquo;s get to some configuration\u0026hellip;\nWindows Go deal with it yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s similar to the Desktop-version available for Mac, but comes with all sorts of caveats you should read through first. It should be fairly straightforward for Windows 10 Users. My suggestion is to simply go with Linux, since our focus is on using Docker for deploying to servers, which are unlikely to be running Windows for the use-cases we have in mind. That said, should be doable, if you insist on it.\nback to top\nConfigure One thing you may notice is that docker commands require the use of sudo, which we would like to avoid. To avoid permission errors (and the use of sudo), add your user to the docker group.\nPost-Installation Steps contains optional procedures for configuring Linux hosts to work better with Docker. The following is taken from that source, and much more Troubleshooting Information can be found there.\nPermissions To create the docker group and add your user:\n Create the docker group. Add your user to the docker group. Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated. Some caveats may apply. 2  sudo groupadd docker sudo usermod -aG docker $USER  Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo.\ndocker run hello-world  This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.\n If you initially ran Docker CLI commands using sudo before adding your user to the docker group, you may see the following error, which indicates that your ~/.docker/ directory was created with incorrect permissions due to the sudo commands.\nWARNING: Error loading config file: /home/user/.docker/config.json - stat /home/user/.docker/config.json: permission denied  To fix this problem, either remove the ~/.docker/ directory (it is recreated automatically, but any custom settings are lost), or change its ownership and permissions using the following commands:\nsudo chown \u0026quot;$USER\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;$USER\u0026quot; /home/\u0026quot;$USER\u0026quot;/.docker -R sudo chmod g+rwx \u0026quot;$HOME/.docker\u0026quot; -R   Start on boot Sometimes you want Docker to be the main thing running on a server and thus started up on boot (for the occasional restart). This feature may be desired for servers that host critical processes using Docker. Most current Linux distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu 16.04 and higher) use systemd to manage which services start when the system boots. 3\nsudo systemctl enable docker  To disable this behavior, use disable instead.\nsudo systemctl disable docker  Re-route IP By default, the Docker daemon listens for connections on a UNIX socket to accept requests from local clients.\nIt is possible to allow Docker to accept requests from remote hosts by configuring it to listen on an IP address and port as well as the UNIX socket.\n For more detailed information on this configuration option take a look at “Bind Docker to another host/port or a unix socket” section of the Docker CLI Reference article.\nSecurity Notice: Before configuring Docker to accept connections from remote hosts it is critically important that you understand the security implications of opening docker to the network. If steps are not taken to secure the connection, it is possible for remote non-root users to gain root access on the host. For more information on how to use TLS certificates to secure this connection, check this article on how to protect the Docker daemon socket.\n Configuring Docker to accept remote connections can be done with the docker.service systemd unit file for Linux distributions using systemd.\n Use the command sudo systemctl edit docker.service to open an override file for docker.service in a text editor.\nAdd or modify the following lines, substituting your own values.\n[Service] ExecStart= ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 Save the file.  Reload the systemctl configuration and restart Docker.\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl restart docker.service   Check to see whether the change was honored by reviewing the output of netstat to confirm dockerd is listening on the configured port, which should look similar to:\n$ sudo netstat -lntp | grep dockerd tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:2375 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 3758/dockerd   To enable IPv6 on the Docker daemon, see Enable IPv6 support.\nTroubleshooting More troubleshooting information can be found in the Troubleshooting section of the Post-Install documentation page.\nHere we attempt to address just a couple of the most common things that we may have to do.\nIP Forwarding If you manually configure your network using systemd-network with systemd version 219 or higher, Docker containers may not be able to access your network.\n Beginning with systemd version 220, the forwarding setting for a given network (net.ipv4.conf.\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;.forwarding) defaults to off. This setting prevents IP forwarding. It also conflicts with Docker’s behavior of enabling the net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding setting within containers.\n  To work around this on RHEL, CentOS, or Fedora, edit the \u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;.network file in /usr/lib/systemd/network/ on your Docker host (ex: /usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-host0.network) and add the following block within the [Network] section.\n[Network] ... IPForward=kernel # OR IPForward=true ...   This configuration allows IP forwarding from the container as expected.\nLimiting You may see\nWARNING: Your kernel does not support swap limit capabilities. Limitation discarded.   This warning does not occur on RPM-based systems, which enable these capabilities by default. If you don’t need these capabilities, you can ignore the warning.\n You can enable these capabilities on Ubuntu or Debian by following these instructions. Memory and swap accounting incur an overhead of about 1% of the total available memory and a 10% overall performance degradation, even if Docker is not running.\n  Log into the Ubuntu or Debian host as a user with sudo privileges.\n Edit the /etc/default/grub file. Add or edit the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX line to add the following two key-value pairs:\n  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\u0026quot;cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1\u0026quot;\nSave and close the file.\n Update GRUB. sudo update-grub  If your GRUB configuration file has incorrect syntax, an error occurs. In this case, repeat steps 3 and 4. The changes take effect when the system is rebooted.\n back to top\nSecurity  This is where security tips about Docker go. The Docker security page goes into more detail.\n First things first: Docker runs as root.\nIf you are in the docker group, you effectively have root access.\nIf you expose the docker UNIX socket to a container, you are giving the container root access to the host.\n Docker should not be your only defense. You should secure and harden it.\n The security tips following are useful if you\u0026rsquo;ve already hardened containers in the past, but are not a substitute for understanding. 4\nSecurity Tips For greatest security, you want to run Docker inside a virtual machine. (Source: Docker Security Team Lead slides / notes.\n Then, run with AppArmor / seccomp / SELinux / grsec etc to limit the container permissions. See the Docker 1.10 security features for more details.\nDocker image ids are sensitive information and should not be exposed to the outside world. Treat them like passwords.\n See the Docker Security Cheat Sheet by Thomas Sjögren: some good stuff about container hardening in there.\nCheck out the docker bench security script for a security benchmark.\n  Download the white papers and subscribe to the mailing lists (unfortunately Docker does not have a unique mailing list, only dev / user). To begin with, see this (foot)note from the cheatsheet 5.\n Deployment Making Docker Safe for Production Since Docker 1.11, you can easily limit the number of active processes running inside a container to prevent fork bombs.\n This requires a Linux kernel \u0026gt;= 4.3 with CGROUP_PIDS=y to be in the kernel configuration.\ndocker run --pids-limit=64  Also available since docker 1.11 is the ability to prevent processes from gaining new privileges.\n This feature have been in the Linux kernel since version 3.5. You can read more about it in this blog post.\ndocker run --security-opt=no-new-privileges   From the Docker Security Cheat Sheet (it\u0026rsquo;s in PDF which makes it hard to use, so copying below) by Container Solutions :\n Be aware that the following may affect the performance of your applications in unexpected ways if you are not sure what kinds of communications requirements you need.\nProceed with caution. Reference the [presentation above][docker-production].\n  Turn off interprocess communication with:\ndocker -d --icc=false --iptables  Set the container to be read-only:\ndocker run --read-only  Verify images with a hashsum:\ndocker pull debian@sha256:a25306f3850e1bd44541976aa7b5fd0a29be  Set volumes to be read only:\ndocker run -v $(pwd)/secrets:/secrets:ro debian  Define and run a user in your Dockerfile so you don\u0026rsquo;t run as root inside the container:\nRUN groupadd -r user \u0026amp;\u0026amp; useradd -r -g user user USER user   Port-Exposal Exposing incoming ports through the host container is fiddly but doable.\n This is done by mapping the container port to the host port (only using localhost interface) using -p:\ndocker run -p 127.0.0.1:$HOSTPORT:$CONTAINERPORT --name CONTAINER -t someimage  You can tell Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime by using EXPOSE:\nEXPOSE \u0026lt;CONTAINERPORT\u0026gt;  Note that EXPOSE does not expose the port itself \u0026ndash; only -p will do that. To expose the container\u0026rsquo;s port on your localhost\u0026rsquo;s port:\niptables -t nat -A DOCKER -p tcp --dport \u0026lt;LOCALHOSTPORT\u0026gt; -j DNAT --to-destination \u0026lt;CONTAINERIP\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;PORT\u0026gt;  If you\u0026rsquo;re running Docker in Virtualbox, you then need to forward the port there as well, using forwarded_port. Define a range of ports in your Vagrantfile like this so you can dynamically map them:\nVagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config| ... (49000..49900).each do |port| config.vm.network :forwarded_port, :host =\u0026gt; port, :guest =\u0026gt; port end ... end  If you forget what you mapped the port to on the host container, use docker port to show it:\ndocker port CONTAINER $CONTAINERPORT  More User Namespaces There\u0026rsquo;s also work on user namespaces \u0026ndash; it is in 1.10 but is not enabled by default.\nTo enable user namespaces (\u0026ldquo;remap the userns\u0026rdquo;) in Ubuntu 15.10, follow the blog example.\nThe Security Roadmap The Docker roadmap talks about seccomp support. There is an AppArmor policy generator called bane, and they\u0026rsquo;re working on security profiles.\nSecurity Videos  Using Docker Safely Securing your applications using Docker Container security: Do containers actually contain? Linux Containers: Future or Fantasy?  back to top\nCheat Sheet The following is full Cheat Sheet mentioned earlier, and presented here for convenience. Feel free to use the table of contents on the right sidebar (or duplicated below for mobile users) to more easily navigate this page than on the Github Gist 6.\nTable of Contents\nImages Images are just templates for docker containers.\nLifecycle  docker images shows all images. docker import creates an image from a tarball. docker build creates image from Dockerfile. docker commit creates image from a container, pausing it temporarily if it is running. docker rmi removes an image. docker load loads an image from a tar archive as STDIN, including images and tags (as of 0.7). docker save saves an image to a tar archive stream to STDOUT with all parent layers, tags \u0026amp; versions (as of 0.7).  Info  docker history shows history of image. docker tag tags an image to a name (local or registry).  Containers Your basic isolated Docker process. Containers are to Virtual Machines as threads are to processes. Or you can think of them as chroots on steroids.\nLifecycle  docker create creates a container but does not start it. docker rename allows the container to be renamed. docker run creates and starts a container in one operation. docker rm deletes a container. docker update updates a container\u0026rsquo;s resource limits.  Normally if you run a container without options it will start and stop immediately, if you want keep it running you can use the command, docker run -td container_id this will use the option -t that will allocate a pseudo-TTY session and -d that will detach automatically the container (run container in background and print container ID).\nIf you want a transient container, docker run --rm will remove the container after it stops.\nIf you want to map a directory on the host to a docker container, docker run -v $HOSTDIR:$DOCKERDIR. Also see Volumes.\nIf you want to remove also the volumes associated with the container, the deletion of the container must include the -v switch like in docker rm -v.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a logging driver available for individual containers in docker 1.10. To run docker with a custom log driver (i.e., to syslog), use docker run --log-driver=syslog.\nAnother useful option is docker run --name yourname docker_image because when you specify the --name inside the run command this will allow you to start and stop a container by calling it with the name the you specified when you created it.\nStarting and Stopping  docker start starts a container so it is running. docker stop stops a running container. docker restart stops and starts a container. docker pause pauses a running container, \u0026ldquo;freezing\u0026rdquo; it in place. docker unpause will unpause a running container. docker wait blocks until running container stops. docker kill sends a SIGKILL to a running container. docker attach will connect to a running container.  If you want to integrate a container with a host process manager, start the daemon with -r=false then use docker start -a.\nIf you want to expose container ports through the host, see the exposing ports section.\nRestart policies on crashed docker instances are covered here.\nCPU Constraints You can limit CPU, either using a percentage of all CPUs, or by using specific cores.\nFor example, you can tell the cpu-shares setting. The setting is a bit strange \u0026ndash; 1024 means 100% of the CPU, so if you want the container to take 50% of all CPU cores, you should specify 512. See https://goldmann.pl/blog/2014/09/11/resource-management-in-docker/#_cpu for more:\ndocker run -ti -c 512 agileek/cpuset-test  You can also only use some CPU cores using cpuset-cpus. See https://agileek.github.io/docker/2014/08/06/docker-cpuset/ for details and some nice videos:\ndocker run -ti --cpuset-cpus=0,4,6 agileek/cpuset-test  Note that Docker can still see all of the CPUs inside the container \u0026ndash; it just isn\u0026rsquo;t using all of them. See https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/20770 for more details.\nMemory Constraints You can also set memory constraints on Docker:\ndocker run -it -m 300M ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash  Capabilities Linux capabilities can be set by using cap-add and cap-drop. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#/runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities for details. This should be used for greater security.\nTo mount a FUSE based filesystem, you need to combine both \u0026ndash;cap-add and \u0026ndash;device:\ndocker run --rm -it --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --device /dev/fuse sshfs  Give access to a single device:\ndocker run -it --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 debian bash  Give access to all devices:\ndocker run -it --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb debian bash  more info about privileged containers here\nInfo  docker ps shows running containers. docker logs gets logs from container. (You can use a custom log driver, but logs is only available for json-file and journald in 1.10). docker inspect looks at all the info on a container (including IP address). docker events gets events from container. docker port shows public facing port of container. docker top shows running processes in container. docker stats shows containers\u0026rsquo; resource usage statistics. docker diff shows changed files in the container\u0026rsquo;s FS.  docker ps -a shows running and stopped containers.\ndocker stats --all shows a running list of containers.\nImport / Export  docker cp copies files or folders between a container and the local filesystem. docker export turns container filesystem into tarball archive stream to STDOUT.  Executing Commands  docker exec to execute a command in container.  To enter a running container, attach a new shell process to a running container called foo, use: docker exec -it foo /bin/bash.\nDockerfile The configuration file.\nSets up a Docker container when you run docker build on it. Vastly preferable to docker commit.\nHere are some common text editors and their syntax highlighting modules you could use to create Dockerfiles:\n Sublime Text 2 Atom Vim Emacs Also see Docker meets the IDE  Instructions  .dockerignore FROM Sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions. MAINTAINER (deprecated - use LABEL instead) Set the Author field of the generated images. RUN execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. CMD provide defaults for an executing container. EXPOSE informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. NOTE: does not actually make ports accessible. ENV sets environment variable. ADD copies new files, directories or remote file to container. Invalidates caches. Avoid ADD and use COPY instead. COPY copies new files or directories to container. Note that this only copies as root, so you have to chown manually regardless of your USER / WORKDIR setting. See https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/30110 ENTRYPOINT configures a container that will run as an executable. VOLUME creates a mount point for externally mounted volumes or other containers. USER sets the user name for following RUN / CMD / ENTRYPOINT commands. WORKDIR sets the working directory. ARG defines a build-time variable. ONBUILD adds a trigger instruction when the image is used as the base for another build. STOPSIGNAL sets the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit. LABEL apply key/value metadata to your images, containers, or daemons.  Tutorial  Flux7\u0026rsquo;s Dockerfile Tutorial  Examples  Examples Best practices for writing Dockerfiles Michael Crosby has some more Dockerfiles best practices / take 2. Building Good Docker Images / Building Better Docker Images Managing Container Configuration with Metadata How to write excellent Dockerfiles  Version  It is very important that you always know the current version of Docker you are currently running on at any point in time. This is very helpful because you get to know what features are compatible with what you have running. This is also important because you know what containers to run from the docker store when you are trying to get template containers. That said let see how to know what version of docker we have running currently\n  docker version checks what version of docker you have running Usage: docker version [OPTIONS]  Get the server version\n$ docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}' 1.8.0  Dump raw JSON data\n$ docker version --format '{{json .}}' {\u0026quot;Client\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;Version\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1.8.0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;ApiVersion\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1.20\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;GitCommit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;f5bae0a\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;GoVersion\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;go1.4.2\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Os\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;linux\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Arch\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;am\u0026quot;}  Cleaning up While you can use the docker rmi command to remove specific images, there\u0026rsquo;s a tool called docker-gc that will safely clean up images that are no longer used by any containers.\nLoad/Save image Load an image from file:\ndocker load \u0026lt; my_image.tar.gz  Save an existing image:\ndocker save my_image:my_tag | gzip \u0026gt; my_image.tar.gz  Import/Export container Import a container as an image from file:\ncat my_container.tar.gz | docker import - my_image:my_tag  Export an existing container:\ndocker export my_container | gzip \u0026gt; my_container.tar.gz  The difference between loading a saved image and importing an exported container as an image\n Loading an image using the load command creates a new image including its history.\nImporting a container as an image using the import command creates a new image, excluding the history, which results in a smaller image size compared to loading an image.\nNetworks  Docker has a networks feature. Not much is known about it, so this is a good place to expand the cheat sheet. There is a note saying that it\u0026rsquo;s a good way to configure docker containers to talk to each other without using ports. See working with networks for more details.\n Lifecycle  docker network create docker network rm  Info  docker network ls docker network inspect  Connection  docker network connect docker network disconnect  You can specify a specific IP address for a container:\n# create a new bridge network with your subnet and gateway for your ip block $ docker network create --subnet 203.0.113.0/24 --gateway 203.0.113.254 iptastic # run a nginx container with a specific ip in that block $ docker run --rm -it --net iptastic --ip 203.0.113.2 nginx # curl the ip from any other place (assuming this is a public ip block duh) $ curl 203.0.113.2  Registries Registries v. Repositories A repository is a hosted collection of tagged images that together create the file system for a container.\n A registry is a host \u0026ndash; a server that stores repositories and provides an HTTP API for managing the uploading and downloading of repositories.\n  Docker.com hosts its own index to a central registry which contains a large number of repositories.\nHaving said that, the central docker registry does not do a good job of verifying images and should be avoided if you\u0026rsquo;re worried about security.\n  docker login to login to a registry. docker logout to logout from a registry. docker search searches registry for image. docker pull pulls an image from registry to local machine. docker push pushes an image to the registry from local machine.  Run local registry You can run a local registry by using the docker distribution project and looking at the local deploy instructions.\nAlso see the mailing list.\nLayers The versioned filesystem in Docker is based on layers. They\u0026rsquo;re like git commits or changesets for filesystems.\nLinks Links are how Docker containers talk to each other through TCP/IP ports. Linking into Redis and Atlassian show worked examples. You can also resolve links by hostname.\nThis has been deprected to some extent by user-defined networks.\nNOTE: If you want containers to ONLY communicate with each other through links, start the docker daemon with -icc=false to disable inter process communication.\nIf you have a container with the name CONTAINER (specified by docker run --name CONTAINER) and in the Dockerfile, it has an exposed port:\nEXPOSE 1337  Then if we create another container called LINKED like so:\ndocker run -d --link CONTAINER:ALIAS --name LINKED user/wordpress  Then the exposed ports and aliases of CONTAINER will show up in LINKED with the following environment variables:\n$ALIAS_PORT_1337_TCP_PORT $ALIAS_PORT_1337_TCP_ADDR  And you can connect to it that way.\nTo delete links, use docker rm --link.\nGenerally, linking between docker services is a subset of \u0026ldquo;service discovery\u0026rdquo;, a big problem if you\u0026rsquo;re planning to use Docker at scale in production. Please read The Docker Ecosystem: Service Discovery and Distributed Configuration Stores for more info.\nVolumes Docker volumes are free-floating filesystems. They don\u0026rsquo;t have to be connected to a particular container. You should use volumes mounted from data-only containers for portability.\nLifecycle  docker volume create docker volume rm  Info  docker volume ls docker volume inspect  Volumes are useful in situations where you can\u0026rsquo;t use links (which are TCP/IP only). For instance, if you need to have two docker instances communicate by leaving stuff on the filesystem.\nYou can mount them in several docker containers at once, using docker run --volumes-from.\nBecause volumes are isolated filesystems, they are often used to store state from computations between transient containers. That is, you can have a stateless and transient container run from a recipe, blow it away, and then have a second instance of the transient container pick up from where the last one left off.\nSee advanced volumes for more details. Container42 is also helpful.\nYou can map MacOS host directories as docker volumes:\ndocker run -v /Users/wsargent/myapp/src:/src  You can use remote NFS volumes if you\u0026rsquo;re feeling brave.\nYou may also consider running data-only containers as described here to provide some data portability.\nBe aware that you can mount files as volumes.\nback to top\nUseful Commands/Tips Sources:\n 15 Docker Tips in 5 minutes CodeFresh Everyday Hacks Docker  Basics Get IP Address docker inspect $(dl) | grep -wm1 IPAddress | cut -d '\u0026quot;' -f 4  or install jq:\ndocker inspect $(dl) | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'  or using a go template:\ndocker inspect -f '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' \u0026lt;container_name\u0026gt;  or when building an image from Dockerfile, when you want to pass in a build argument:\nDOCKER_HOST_IP=`ifconfig | grep -E \u0026quot;([0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\u0026quot; | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{ print $2 }' | cut -f2 -d: | head -n1` echo DOCKER_HOST_IP = $DOCKER_HOST_IP docker build \\ --build-arg ARTIFACTORY_ADDRESS=$DOCKER_HOST_IP -t sometag \\ some-directory/  Get Port Mapping docker inspect -f '{{range $p, $conf := .NetworkSettings.Ports}} {{$p}} -\u0026gt; {{(index $conf 0).HostPort}} {{end}}' \u0026lt;containername\u0026gt;  Management Find containers using regular expression: for i in $(docker ps -a | grep \u0026quot;REGEXP_PATTERN\u0026quot; | cut -f1 -d\u0026quot; \u0026quot;); do echo $i; done  Get environment settings docker run --rm ubuntu env  Kill running containers docker kill $(docker ps -q)  Delete all containers (force!! running or stopped containers) docker rm -f $(docker ps -qa)  Delete old containers docker ps -a | grep 'weeks ago' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm  Delete stopped containers docker rm -v $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)  Delete containers after stopping docker stop $(docker ps -aq) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; docker rm -v $(docker ps -aq)  Delete dangling images docker rmi $(docker images -q -f dangling=true)  Delete all images docker rmi $(docker images -q)  Delete dangling volumes As of Docker 1.9:\ndocker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q -f dangling=true)  In 1.9.0, the filter dangling=false does not work - it is ignored and will list all volumes.\nShow image dependencies docker images -viz | dot -Tpng -o docker.png  df docker system df presents a summary of the space currently used by different docker objects.\nHeredoc Docker Container docker build -t htop - \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF FROM alpine RUN apk --no-cache add htop EOF  Prune The new Data Management Commands have landed as of Docker 1.13:\n docker system prune docker volume prune docker network prune docker container prune docker image prune  Last Ids alias dl='docker ps -l -q' docker run ubuntu echo hello world docker commit $(dl) helloworld  Commit with command (needs Dockerfile)\ndocker commit -run='{\u0026quot;Cmd\u0026quot;:[\u0026quot;postgres\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-too -many -opts\u0026quot;]}' $(dl) postgres  Monitoring Monitor system resource utilization for running containers To check the CPU, memory, and network I/O usage of a single container, you can use:\ndocker stats \u0026lt;container\u0026gt;  For all containers listed by id:\ndocker stats $(docker ps -q)  For all containers listed by name:\ndocker stats $(docker ps --format '{{.Names}}')  For all containers listed by image:\ndocker ps -a -f ancestor=ubuntu  Remove all untagged images\ndocker rmi $(docker images | grep “^” | awk '{split($0,a,\u0026quot; \u0026quot;); print a[3]}')  Remove container by a regular expression\ndocker ps -a | grep wildfly | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm -f  Remove all exited containers\ndocker rm -f $(docker ps -a | grep Exit | awk '{ print $1 }')  Volumes can be files Be aware that you can mount files as volumes.

Building a Development Environment With Docker (2013) Discourse in a Docker Container (2013)   In this tutorial, we will be using Linux since that is what almost every server runs, but as the principle of Docker is that it makes applications independent of platforms, everything herein should be applicable no matter what machine you are running. ^ If testing on a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect. On a desktop Linux environment such as X Windows, log out of your session completely and then log back in. ^ Ubuntu 14.10 and below use upstart. See the post-installation instructions for support. ^ For an understanding of what containers leave exposed, you should read Understanding and Hardening Linux Containers by Aaron Grattafiori. This is a complete and comprehensive guide to the issues involved with containers, with a plethora of links and footnotes leading on to yet more useful content. ^ You should start off by using a kernel with unstable patches for grsecurity / pax compiled in, such as Alpine Linux. If you are using grsecurity in production, you should spring for commercial support for the stable patches, same as you would do for RedHat.

It involved some research and collection of resources from disparated places and things I\u0026rsquo;ve done before.\nI also sat down and in a couple minutes managed to figure out the \u0026ldquo;breaking changes\u0026rdquo; to my MathematicalMichael website under Hugo v0.52. The only file that needed to be changed (before updating the theme, that is) was the $i, reference in a file I made myself:\nvim themes/academic/layouts/partials/artwork_links.html  Next step was to copy the theme from michaelpilosov/ (which pulled from the github repo only a few days prior, and to which some minor changes were made) into mathematicalmichael/themes/ along with a copy of the config file.\nOnce the reference to the new theme is made, I expect a number of things to break. Here I will attempt to document one-by-one the changes I had to make to port my theme over, which I will attempt to do by leveraging the \u0026ldquo;lookup structure\u0026rdquo; of Hugo (something I read online). The idea is that rather than make changes to a theme that result in deviations that make merging new changes difficult, one makes changes by copying files into directories that are checked first, before themes/ is searched for layouts or partials files. My hope is that this will aid in future upgrades, since less differences will exist between my version of the theme and the master branch. A really useful command (for comparing files), that I used to see what needed to change in the master configuration file for my theme (compared to the updated one from this website) was:\ndiff -y file1.md file2.md  which will print out two files side-by-side directly into the UNIX Terminal. Excellent.\nAfter making the appropriate changes to the config.toml file (which were all straightforward), I ensured that the site built with the new Hugo and the new configuration file but without the new theme. It did. All was well.\nThen I changed the theme to point to the updated one:\ntheme = \u0026quot;hugo-academic\u0026quot;  which yielded the following error (kind of expected to be honest):\nError: Error building site: failed to render pages: render of \u0026quot;home\u0026quot; failed: execute of template failed: template: index.html:4:3: executing \u0026quot;index.html\u0026quot; at \u0026lt;partial \u0026quot;widget_page...\u0026gt;: error calling partial: \u0026quot;/media/mathematicalmichael/HANK/repos/mathematicalmichael/themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials/widget_page.html:23:9\u0026quot;: execute of template failed: template: partials/widget_page.html:23:9: executing \u0026quot;partials/widget_page.html\u0026quot; at \u0026lt;partial $widget $par...\u0026gt;: error calling partial: Partial \u0026quot;widgets/artworks.html\u0026quot; not found  So why did this happen?\nWell, I had defined my own template page called artworks that was modeled on the publications style of page. I used this to publish a webpage for each piece of art, complete with a rich tagging-system automated through Python. I made random art and had written code that created pages for that art to live on. Any changes made to the front-matter could be easily applied later.\nI believe that simply moving some files to directories that exist above themes will resolve my problems.\nHowever, I know there will be an opportunity to switch to page-bundles and leverage the image-gallery feature in v3.0 of Hugo-Academic. My thinking is as follows:\n Instead of daily pages, make weekly ones as galleries. Alternatively, keep daily postings as-is, and add galleries additionally. See if you can link images to the main folder, so all art can continue to live in one folder without duplicates. You can make galleries using page-bundles as a separate way to interact with the art. Definitely need to integrate a widget page that hosts all the art. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to clutter the home page with everything.\n I think that clicking from the main menu to art/ should suffice. Curate the experience, minimize contact with /artwork/ page (i.e. make slideshows link to other content rather than the search they perform now, which can be a bit slow.  Since slideshows are just a markdown file, we should have no trouble linking to images in another folder!\n will take some playing around to figure out exactly the right directory structure.   ** Main Goal ** for the time being is to make sure the site builds with the new theme. We can add features and functionality later on. Today\u0026rsquo;s agenda is simply to allow migration to Hugo v0.52 on my Macbook by ensuring the site builds with the new version. Having the new theme work would be an added bonus.\n I suspect all that needs to happen is a little migration of partials and shortcodes.\n cp themes/academic/layouts/partials/artwork_* layouts/partials/  Did not change the error.\nmkdir layouts/partials/widgets/ cp themes/academic/layouts/partials/widgets/artworks* layouts/partials/widgets/  Resolved that but sprang a new error:\nError: Error building site: failed to render pages: render of \u0026quot;home\u0026quot; failed: execute of template failed: template: index.html:4:3: executing \u0026quot;index.html\u0026quot; at \u0026lt;partial \u0026quot;widget_page...\u0026gt;: error calling partial: \u0026quot;/media/mathematicalmichael/HANK/repos/mathematicalmichael/themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials/widget_page.html:23:9\u0026quot;: execute of template failed: template: partials/widget_page.html:23:9: executing \u0026quot;partials/widget_page.html\u0026quot; at \u0026lt;partial $widget $par...\u0026gt;: error calling partial: Partial \u0026quot;widgets/search.html\u0026quot; not found  Okay, so let\u0026rsquo;s move widgets/search.html over?\ncp themes/academic/layouts/partials/widgets/search.html layouts/partials/widgets/  hugo server --disableFastRender  And that did it! Wow, relatively painless. Now let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks.\nThe layout is dark for some reason\u0026hellip; Enabling light/dark mode shows me the white I want to see but with inverted header. :mailto icon is broken. Change to \u0026ldquo;fas\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;fab\u0026rdquo; in config.toml, line 293.\nBack to the theme.. let\u0026rsquo;s grab a file and move it to the root directory and figure out where to put it.\ncp themes/hugo-academic/data/themes/dark.toml . mkdir data mkdir data/themes mv dark.toml data/themes/  I then proceeded to change some things to get the right colors. Still not sure if this is correct. I also changed the theme to self.toml and referenced that in the config.toml file.\nNext test: Day/Night mode (re-enable, see what happens).\nDay Mode is fine. Night mode makes my logos look weird (though I do like the look overall). Top bar is also white instead of black for some reason.\nEditing data/themes/self.toml to rename the theme (mistake to not have done that before), and toggle light = true, since I did make it into a light theme.\n# Theme metadata name = \u0026quot;Self\u0026quot; # Is theme light or dark? light = true # Primary primary = \u0026quot;hsl(339, 90%, 68%)\u0026quot; primary_light = \u0026quot;hsl(339, 90%, 78%)\u0026quot; primary_dark = \u0026quot;hsl(339, 90%, 58%)\u0026quot; # Menu menu_primary = \u0026quot;#fff\u0026quot; menu_text = \u0026quot;rgba(0,0,0,0.6)\u0026quot; menu_text_active = \u0026quot;hsl(339, 90%, 68%)\u0026quot; menu_title = \u0026quot;#2b2b2b\u0026quot; # Home sections home_section_odd = \u0026quot;rgb(255, 255, 255)\u0026quot; home_section_even = \u0026quot;rgb(247, 247, 247)\u0026quot;  Note: Also broken is the search widget. Sad.\nDisable search widget\u0026hellip; Should not have moved it in the first place! There is a new search feature that renders this one useless. I will now remove the search.html widget (and search.md from content/home/\nContact form\u0026hellip; Had to paste in the new format. I was using a custom partial code (note to self\u0026hellip; delete that) to make a formspree link. Now I don\u0026rsquo;t have to!\nAlso, remove Search from menu in config.toml. After deleting layouts/shortcodes/contactme.html (my custom formspree link), in favor of using the one the upgraded theme provided, it appears that my website is now settled into the new theme. I did have to remove all references to this deleted shortcode, of course.\nDay/night mode works correctly. (would like to make my logo transparent though).\nOkay, well I knew it was too good to be true that things just worked. While pages loaded correctly, before building the final site, I made sure to investigate the directories a bit more and found that a bunch of files prepended with ._XXX.md had populated my website directories. This must be how they\u0026rsquo;re ensuring backward-compatibility.\nWell, I refactored the pages into page bundles with this shell script:\n#!/bin/sh # Helps migrate from v2.4.0 to v3.0.0 # # Refactor a page named `X.md` to `content/\u0026lt;section\u0026gt;/X/index.md` to use the # new page bundles and featured image system # # - E.g. a post `content/post/X.md` is converted to `content/post/X/index.md` refactor_pages_to_page_bundles() { if [ ! -d ./content/ ]; then echo \u0026quot;Please run script from root of hugo site\u0026quot; fi local files=\u0026quot;$(find ./content/ -iname '*.md' -not -iname '*index.md' -not -ipath './content/home/*')\u0026quot; for file in ${files}; do local pagedir=\u0026quot;${file%.md}\u0026quot; echo \u0026quot;${file} -\u0026gt; ${pagedir}/index.md\u0026quot; if [ ! -d \u0026quot;${pagedir}\u0026quot; ]; then mkdir \u0026quot;${pagedir}\u0026quot; fi mv \u0026quot;${file}\u0026quot; \u0026quot;${pagedir}/index.md\u0026quot; done } # Bash Strict Mode set -eu # set -x refactor_pages_to_page_bundles \u0026quot;$@\u0026quot;  Source\nAfter poking around, it looks like the pages obey the proper structure now (for the most part)\u0026hellip; There are a few stray .md files around.\nI will push the changes live but later on go through both websites to ensure that bundles are everywhere and no stray pages are left.\nTo Do Notably, I will need to\n update my python script that writes project pages and art pages. ensure featured images (optional) are properly handled find out how galleries can work with the artwork/images directory, which so far doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be conflicting with the page-bundle format. Make sure the artwork search works. Seems to be broken, though publications search still works.  Oh, I think all that needs to happen is to move /themes/academic/layouts/artwork into the layouts folder I have in my root directory.\nmv themes/academic/layouts/artwork/ layouts/  But that led to an error regarding partial header_image.html. Thus, it seems like I will need to copy the new publication template over and edit it again. At least this time I will document it.\ncp themes/hugo-academic/layouts/publication/single.html layouts/artwork/  And then I replaced all instances of publication with artwork\nBut that still didn\u0026rsquo;t lead to the filter-ability that I wanted.\nThe default behavior was to paginate and list all of the art, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t have image previews but honestly is just fine, especially since it loads quickly.\nThe widget on the homepage that links to the search of artwork though is now broken as a consequence. I can fall back on searching by tags, or disable the widget temporarily until I set up galleries for the artworks.\n If I write a python script that scrapes the artwork/images folder and creates galleries linked to that, well that would be just perfect. This widget can be linked to those galleries, or slideshows. Disable it for now.  Okay, later at night I had to come across this as well, but I wanted the listing of artworks in their projects, so I copied the new layouts/partials/project/single.html into the layouts/partials/projects/ directory I created and pasted the following relevant chunk of code:\n\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt; Archive \u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; {{ $items := where (where .Site.RegularPages \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot; \u0026quot;artwork\u0026quot;) \u0026quot;.Params.projects\u0026quot; \u0026quot;intersect\u0026quot; (slice $project) }} {{ $items := $items | union (where (where .Site.RegularPages \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot; \u0026quot;artwork\u0026quot;) \u0026quot;.Params.url_project\u0026quot; $project_path) }} {{ $arts_len := len $items }} {{ if ge $arts_len 1 }} \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ (i18n \u0026quot;artworks\u0026quot;) }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; {{ range $items }} {{ if eq $page.Site.Params.projects.artwork_format 1 }} {{ partial \u0026quot;artwork_li_detailed\u0026quot; . }} {{ else }} {{ partial \u0026quot;artwork_li_simple\u0026quot; . }} {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ end }}  And I got my desired lists!\nSee here for example.\n","date":1545375600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545375600,"objectID":"31596d5731c13c1c4c447cb6af2f9b22","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/changelog/day3/","publishdate":"2018-12-21T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/changelog/day3/","section":"changelog","summary":"Filling in the Docs","tags":["demo"],"title":"Day 3","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Let\u0026rsquo;s first get a feel for the possibilities, and see what is possible by checking out some existing websites, organizations, and repositories.

Feel free to use your own.\nAnd one for python2:\nconda create -n py2 python=2.7\nTo remove:\nconda remove --name py2 --all\nWe can now switch between versions of python with commands like\nsource activate py3 and source activate py2 and then source deactivate when you\u0026rsquo;re ready to be done.\nDiving Deeper Widgets Overview:\npip install ipywidgets\njupyter nbextension install --py --user widgetsnbextension\njupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension\nMore information about widgets can be found here\nAlternatively, in each of these environments, run\nconda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets\nwhich will install all sorts of dependencies, including Jupyter notebooks2.

The version of python used for the kernel is whatever is returned when you ask bash which python (so if you used source activate earlier, it will be the version associated with the kernel whose name is in parentheses in your Terminal session). The --user flag is necessary.\niPyParallel https://github.com/ipython/ipyparallel\npip install ipyparallel to install.\nipcluster nbextension enable (add the --user flag as well if you encounter an error).

The Hub can offer notebook servers to a class of students, a corporate data science workgroup, a scientific research project, or a high performance computing group.\nTechnical overview Three main actors make up JupyterHub:\n multi-user Hub (tornado process) configurable http proxy (node-http-proxy) multiple single-user Jupyter notebook servers (Python/Jupyter/tornado)  Basic principles for operation are:\n Hub launches a proxy. Proxy forwards all requests to Hub by default. Hub handles login, and spawns single-user servers on demand. Hub configures proxy to forward url prefixes to the single-user notebook servers.  JupyterHub also provides a REST API for administration of the Hub and its users.\n I personally run Jupyterhub on a remote server so that I always have access to a secure and familiar environment if I ever need to test out some code and find myself without my laptop. By default, it accepts the login information of just the user who is running it, but we will see later how it can be configured for its intended use as a multi-user authentication hub.\n","date":1545375600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545375600,"objectID":"7a60d3f11ac50872f40feeb46328b4ef","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/openscience/getting-started/","publishdate":"2018-12-21T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/openscience/getting-started/","section":"openscience","summary":"Basics In this documentation, we will research and likely leverage (most if not all of) the following open-source projects.

The ideal scenario is to have Binder installed on a server, and we discuss the process of setting up such a server in this documentation, but for now we address setting up an environment on your own computer.\nWe focus here on Python, and rely on Anaconda deployed on a Linux distribution. Here, we use Ubuntu 18.04, but the instructions should be comparable on previous versions as well as on Mac and Windows, though some of the interactions in the command-line will be different for Windows users.\nHistory (This brief history represents the view of the author of this webpage and may not be completely accurate).\nProject Jupyter is the maturation of the iPython project, a command-line program that allowed for an interactive Python shell, and what I relied on in my early days of learning Python. Their flagship development/breakthrough was the Notebook, which forms the foundation for all the other products.\nThe notebook is an HTML page that is served for you by a jupyter notebook server. It looks and feels like a desktop application. It was undoubtedly inspired by Mathematica\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Notebooks,\u0026rdquo; but released as an open-source project, leading to its rapidly-expanding adoption in the scientific community.\nThe key to understanding why the notebook is so special is that it allows the web-browser to interact with code running on any computer (be it your own or a remote server). By divorcing the computation from the rendering, the developers allow for a unified framework so that scientists can focus on writing code and not on keeping up with dev-ops architecture.\nThe idea is simply that once one adapts to the Jupyter ecosystem, they are freed from platform considerations. Code is shareable across Windows/Mac/Linux, and viewable in the same environment that it was developed in by using a web-browser. It seeks to completely replace IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), which were the best solutions for setting up someone who was new to programming.\nBasically, there was a serious desire to make getting up-and-running with software development easier.

Group-level events allow cooperation to thrive under unfavorable conditions such as low intra-group assortment and moderate rates of migration, and can greatly speed up the evolution of cooperation when conditions are more favorable. The time-dependent effects of fission and extinction events are studied and illustrated here using a PDE model of a group-structured population based loosely on populations of hunter-gatherer tribes. By solving the PDE numerically we can compare models with and without group- level events, and explicitly calculate quantities associated with dynamics, like how long it takes a small population of cooperators to become a majority, as well as equilibrium population densities.","tags":["biology","evolution"],"title":"Group-level events are catalysts in the evolution of cooperation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461736800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461736800,"objectID":"91dd82e17bf6548e783db919f2f1fae8","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/project/consistentbayes/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/consistentbayes/","section":"project","summary":"A repository I wrote for my PhD research.","tags":["code"],"title":"Consistent Bayes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"                                                                                                      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
