      <description>I decided to explore the use of Twitter&amp;rsquo;s API in Python to perform some fun projects.
I wrote a Twitter bot called &amp;ldquo;Random Art Baby&amp;rdquo; that when prompted, would respond to users with artwork.
This art was randomly generated using the library I had developed for my initial exploration with graphical user interfaces for visualizing probability distributions.
This also provided me the opportunity to explore some machine learning code for the generation of natural language speech based on training examples.</description>

      <title>Probably Art</title>

      <description>After my first experience with writing software in the summer of 2013, I wanted to learn how to write software that was usable by other people1.
I thought that learning how graphical user interfaces work would be a good place to start. Since I already knew Matlab, I chose that for my programming language.
I performed the project under the direction of use of Dr. Yusuf Bilgic, who generally gave me free rein to pursue the project in any direction.</description>

      <description>Overview I received an Undergraduate Fellowship from the Geneseo Foundation to pursue a self-directed research project wherein I would explore the interface of Arts, Mathematics and Computer Science.
 My initial goal was to figure out how to take a still image and turn it into an animation without resorting to frame-by-frame editing.
 Story My mentor introduced me to a professor in the computer science department and we composed a successful proposal for the fellowship program.</description>
