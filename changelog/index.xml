      <description>Today I began to structure and fill in the basic information for the Open Science/Docker Documentation.
I also realized I needed to edit the table of contents with some custom CSS.
Create a custom file in /static/css and link it to line custom_css = [] in config.toml:
#TableOfContents{ padding-left: 10px }  </description>

      <description>Today I began to structure and fill in the basic information for the Open Science Documentation. It involved some research and collection of resources from disparated places and things I&amp;rsquo;ve done before.
I also sat down and in a couple minutes managed to figure out the &amp;ldquo;breaking changes&amp;rdquo; to my MathematicalMichael website under Hugo v0.52. The only file that needed to be changed (before updating the theme, that is) was the $i, reference in a file I made myself:</description>

      <description>Summary I spent the day working with the widget library and understanding how interpolating polynomials are handled by scipy. Most of today&amp;rsquo;s developments were concerned with my random art and animation libraries, and I completed some of the most important components of the interface: setting time-dependent functions (independent of frames), and creating a widget that properly reads/writes data to a dictionary.
I still need to link the interfaces for the existing GUIs that write the properties.</description>

      <description>Introduction This documents the changes made to the academic theme to make this website work when upgrading from Hugo ver=0.47 and Academic Theme ver=2.4.
The upgrade for this website was performed on 12-19-2018.
All in all, it took the better part of an entire day to get familiar with all the nooks and crannies of the new updates and plan out the migration of the more complicated website&amp;hellip; Mathematical Michael.</description>
