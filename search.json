Group-level events allow cooperation to thrive under unfavorable conditions such as low intra-group assortment and moderate rates of migration, and can greatly speed up the evolution of cooperation when conditions are more favorable. The time-dependent effects of fission and extinction events are studied and illustrated here using a PDE model of a group-structured population based loosely on populations of hunter-gatherer tribes. By solving the PDE numerically we can compare models with and without group- level events, and explicitly calculate quantities associated with dynamics, like how long it takes a small population of cooperators to become a majority, as well as equilibrium population densities.","tags":["biology","evolution"],"title":"Group-level events are catalysts in the evolution of cooperation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461736800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461736800,"objectID":"91dd82e17bf6548e783db919f2f1fae8","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/project/consistentbayes/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/consistentbayes/","section":"project","summary":"A repository I wrote for my PhD research.","tags":["code"],"title":"Consistent Bayes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1457161200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1457161200,"objectID":"a5b174ebb4c148ba492b93be65bb2c7a","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/talk/framsc16/","publishdate":"2016-03-05T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/framsc16/","section":"talk","summary":"Assisted with organization in my capacity as Vice President of the SIAM Student Chapter.\n","tags":[],"title":"[ Volunteer ]","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1436940000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1436940000,"objectID":"933b266b75dc2dc035f13790c154805b","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/talk/rmswuq15/","publishdate":"2015-07-15T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/rmswuq15/","section":"talk","summary":"\n","tags":[],"title":"[ Volunteer ]","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1426312800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1426312800,"objectID":"b5ccd4478ece5e523a4acef3149179c2","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/talk/siam_cse15/","publishdate":"2015-03-14T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/siam_cse15/","section":"talk","summary":"We present a means of developing digital image transformations that allow a still image to be turned into a short and visually pleasing animation.

Our current progress with this undertaking will be presented.\n","tags":[],"title":"Pharma Mutuals","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1397368800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1397368800,"objectID":"83b75e0729d57fa1bd568b6881de5779","permalink":"https://www.michaelpilosov.com/talk/great14-art/","publishdate":"2014-04-13T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/great14-art/","section":"talk","summary":"We will demonstrate an application that allows one to create artistic images using probability distributions with an intuitive GUI.

Rather than manually augmenting successive frames to create the illusion of motion, the method presented here requires only the input of a few parameters for each transformation. We developed a mathematical framework wherein we defined animations as sequences of still images, and “transformations” as composable functions on such sequences.\n\nTo implement this work, we have built a MATLAB library of composable functions that streamline the process of turning still images into novel animations. Examples include manipulation of contrast, intensity, and colors of pixels, as well as warps of contours, positions, and size of select regions. The transformations allow for easy animation of regions of interest, giving some semblance of life to still images by turning them into animated GIFs.\n","tags":[],"title":"Animating Still Images","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I was selected as one of eight students from the liberal arts college to attend this regional conference on behalf of SUNY Geneseo.

However,  to the best of my knowledge, no one has created animated GIFs solely from  a single still image.  I believe  this  is  because  current  technology  requires  tedious  manual  alteration  of  successive frames  to  create  such  animations.  I  investigated  whether  it  is  possible  to  automate  this  manual process  with  digital  image  transformations  by  working  at  the  interdisciplinary  intersection  of mathematics,  computer  science,  and  art.I  developed  a  mathematical  framework  wherein  I defined  “animations”  as  sequences  of  still  images,  and  “transformations”  as  composable functions  that  work  on  such  sequences.  To  implement  these  concepts,  I  built  a  library  of MATLAB functions that simplify and streamline the entire creative process by requiring only the input  of  a  few  parameters. Examples  include  manipulation  of  contrast,  intensity,  and  colors  of pixels,  as  well  as  warps  of  contours,  positions,  and  size  of  select  regions.  The  transformations allow for easy animation of regions of interest, giving some semblance of life to still images by turning  them  into  animated  GIFS.I  will  showcase  some  of  the  potential  of  this  work  when artistic layering of effects is performed.\n","tags":[],"title":"Moving Pictures?!

The focus of the study was to analyze the efficacy of various strategies aimed at leveling major crop yield fluctuations projected by the simulation.

Basic strategy is simple to understand but the reasoning behind the probabilistic advantage is full of nuance and complications. We will provide a conceptual understanding of the mathematics underlying the advantage of counting cards in Blackjack. Multiple strategies will be discussed with attention to their relative benefits and efficacy of shifting the probability of winning towards the player and away from the casino. We will explain analytical approaches such as the Monte Carlo Method, a simulation method dependent on randomness; and the Kelly Criterion, a popular formula for scaling bet sizes.\n","tags":[],"title":"So You Want to Count Cards?","type":"talk"}]
