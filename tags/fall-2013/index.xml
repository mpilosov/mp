      <description>Overview I received an Undergraduate Fellowship from the Geneseo Foundation to pursue a self-directed research project wherein I would explore the interface of Arts, Mathematics and Computer Science.
 My initial goal was to figure out how to take a still image and turn it into an animation without resorting to frame-by-frame editing.
 Story My mentor introduced me to a professor in the computer science department and we composed a successful proposal for the fellowship program.</description>

      <description>Summary Along with some good friends, I helped re-establish this defunct club and secure funding for club meetings and events.
My primary responsibilities included all publicity operations and planning the charity fundraisers.
We held weekly meetings and grew from two tables to as many as twelve simultaneous games happening. Snacks were provided and occasionally we were able to provide pizza.
  Waiting for announcements to end so chess can start.</description>

      <description>Four years of active participation in a Service Organization. Almost countless events.
I joined my first semester in undergrad, and remained an active member every semester that I was enrolled in college.
Pillars of the Organization  Scholarship Service Unity Fitness Loyalty   Here is a reproduction of a Lamron Article about the organization. It was written the semester I joined! 
 Men of Action and Change, an organization founded at Geneseo in 1997, is a multicultural group dedicated to continuing a legacy of service and support to the local and global communities.</description>
