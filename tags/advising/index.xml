      <description>You have to find someone you want to learn from.
That is what can make the difference between five years in graduate school and seven years. It can mean the difference between being lost and being directed in a productive manner.
Maybe I got lucky, but my present advisor has rarely let me go in a research direction that didn&amp;rsquo;t bear fruit of some kind or another. He knew when to shield me from complexity and when to implore me to pursue deeper understanding.</description>

      <description>Getting to Grad School As an undergraduate, I first experienced the extent to which mathematics could be broadly applied to &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; problems, and recognized the potential to make substantive change. I set my sights on a job in industry, with vague hopes and aspirations as to what such a thing might look like. I had been applying to summer programs that would potentially expose me to application areas every.</description>
