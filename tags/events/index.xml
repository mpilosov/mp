      <description>Math Club began to host regular movie nights each semester, highlighting films about mathematicians. We hoped to reach a broader audience outside the math department by hosting these events in very public locations with generous catering budgets.

      <description>Math Club held several Poker and Game nights, where we provided food and snacks for students to come and relax after a long day at school and enjoy a social space that did not involve alcohol/drugs (nor much math).
At one of these, we also had the opportunity to introduce a game that Dr. Simon I had worked on, since I finally managed to write a program in a way that could be used by other people.</description>

      <title>Mentor Lunch</title>

      <description>As President of SIAM, I organized a regular mentor lunch that we started to run every semester. What motivated me was noticing that undergraduates with whom I spoke were routinely unaware of their career options. It was completely unclear what courses they should take because they had a hard time connecting what they liked to possible career paths. Many did not know that graduate school could be paid for! The course descriptions were not particularly helpful since they contained jargon that was unfamiliar to students.</description>

      <description>Billiards night was one of the first events that Christina and I plan for Math Club. It was a relatively simple event, focused on bringing together people For a night of pool and pizza. We played videos about billiards, including ones that went over the geometry of planning different types of shots on televisions in the background of the pool hall. We held this event several times over the years.</description>

      <description>As part of the activities we implemented in Math Club, we got the Math Department involved in a campus-wide competition to donate food to the campus food pantry, which serves students in crisis1.
We routinely placed in the top three, and even took first place twice, beating out the Office of the Dean and the Graduate School.
  We had three purple bins in the department, and we made sure they all looked like this.</description>

      <description>This student conference brings together students from a number of universities in the Rocky Mountain Region to give presentations in an intimate environment. I have been involved in some way or another in its organization for all my years at CU Denver.
As President I helped change the way we secure funding for the event and increased our budget for food by working out an agreement with our student government association to co-sponsor the event.</description>

      <title>Study Hall</title>

      <description>The departmentâ€™s semesterly two-day study hall that precedes final examinations experienced a dramatic increase in attendance.
I attribute this to my aggressive advertising efforts and the President (Christina Ebben, pictured below) and I coordinating an unprecedented funding campaign to attract attendees.
Snacks (fruits, nuts, chips, sodas, etc) and coffee were plentiful fuel for students, and lunches were purchased for the volunteers. The tutors provided by Math Club and SIAM provide much needed emotional and educational support for the student body.</description>

      <description>In my first year (2014-2015) of becoming involved in Math Club, I threw this poster together for a pretty simple event.   For Pi Day, Math Club organized several events over the years that focused on simply enjoying the festivities, eating pie, and trying to bring in people from outside of the department&amp;rsquo;s and engage with the broader community.
  Second year.   One year we chose to fundraise and partnered with a local pizzeria to set up a day where a portion of their profits would be donated to girls who code, a nonprofit that focuses on education in programming.</description>
