      <description>Jan 1, 2019 Status Report Okay so where are we at?
 Spawner needs to be sussed out. Right now I really like DockerSpawner, and it seems to persist storage.  Each student gets a user account but it&amp;rsquo;s only used for authenetication right now. Can&amp;rsquo;t figure out volume-mapping.  With dockerspawner.DockerSpawner:
 Each time someone is logged in, a container is either loaded up or built from jupyterlab_img container.</description>

      <description>Dec 22, 2018 Today I began to structure and fill in the basic information for the Open Science/Docker Documentation.
12/24/2019 - 01/01/2019

      <description>Jan 1, 2019 Today I split up the documentation here on devlog and began the write-ups for Jupyterhub. I think I should segment out a section that goes through the entire process of deployment
Notes: - bash script to give you nice shortcuts - SSH key generated ahead of time, ready to log in without passwords - get Traefik proxy working - It seems extremely straightforward except that I do not know how to direct traffic to a folder.</description>
