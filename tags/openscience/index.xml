      <description>Status Report Okay so where are we at?
 Spawner needs to be sussed out. Right now I really like DockerSpawner, and it seems to persist storage.  Each student gets a user account but it&amp;rsquo;s only used for authenetication right now. Can&amp;rsquo;t figure out volume-mapping.  With dockerspawner.DockerSpawner:

Deploying Jupyter Notebooks for Students and Researchers (PyData 2016)   Managing a 1000+ Student JupyterHub without Losing your Sanity (JupyterCon 2018)   Here are the stated goals in the video:</description>

      <description>Today I began to structure and fill in the basic information for the Open Science/Docker Documentation.

Create a custom file in /static/css and link it to line custom_css = [] in config.toml:
#TableOfContents{ padding-left: 10px }  </description>
