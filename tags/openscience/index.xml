      <description>Jan 1, 2019 Status Report Okay so where are we at?
 Spawner needs to be sussed out. Right now I really like DockerSpawner, and it seems to persist storage.  Each student gets a user account but it&amp;rsquo;s only used for authenetication right now. Can&amp;rsquo;t figure out volume-mapping.  With dockerspawner.DockerSpawner:
 Each time someone is logged in, a container is either loaded up or built from jupyterlab_img container.</description>

      <description>Dec 22, 2018 Today I began to structure and fill in the basic information for the Open Science/Docker Documentation.

      <description>Jan 1, 2019 Today I split up the documentation here on devlog and began the write-ups for Jupyterhub. I think I should segment out a section that goes through the entire process of deployment
Notes: - bash script to give you nice shortcuts - SSH key generated ahead of time, ready to log in without passwords - get Traefik proxy working - It seems extremely straightforward except that I do not know how to direct traffic to a folder.</description>

      <description>Scientific Computation for Research and Teaching with Jupyter Michael Pilosov, University of Colorado Denver
Motivation and Qualifiers  Love applied math&amp;hellip; Hate the learning curve Want to make (computational) math accessible Some familiarity with website design Vague understanding of application architecture  Backstory  Wanted to embed interactive content into website Difficulty with back-end, lack of understanding Kept seeing some of the same words/phrases  Docker, Servers, Databases, Ports, Containers, Volumes, Mounting, Images, Spawning, etc.</description>
