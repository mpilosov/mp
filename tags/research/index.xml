      <description>Please pardon our mess.   This page is still a work in progress.   I have many projects that I am documenting simultaneously and am doing my best to be thorough and embed a lot of rich metadata so that you can click around based on what you find interesting.  Please feel free to contact me if you want me to finish this particular page immediately.</description>

      <description>The novel framework for solving inverse problems in which all of my doctoral work has been grounded.
In the broadest terms possible, Data-Consistent Inversion (DCI) is a new approach to answer questions about the conditions under which observations can occur.
What makes it particularly special is that in a sense, this approach leverages the &amp;ldquo;best of both worlds&amp;rdquo; in the statistical inference world. The two schools of thought: Deterministic Optimization and Bayesian Statistics have different philosophical frameworks for answering questions pertaining to the explanation of observed data.</description>

      <description>Slamming one of the servers when no one else was using it.   Overview I went to work with Dr. Velimir Vesselinov in the summer of 2017 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). This experience drastically changed the direction of my research. I spent much of my time reading papers on Bayesian Inverse Problems and Subsurface Contaminant Transport Problems. Part of what I did was learn the Julia programming language1, implementing some Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to practice, and converting some algorithms from Python to Julia.</description>

      <description>Summary My advisor developed a framework for solving a large class of problems of particular interest to the engineering disciplines. Starting as a graduate research assistant under his direction in the summer of 2015, I began to learn about this new method and explore implications of how measurements of physical systems are taken on our ability to accurately describe parameter uncertainty sets.
You can read more about it below, but overall, my focus on skewness ended up playing a less important role when we developed a sample-based approach to solving the same problems.</description>

      <description>This was my first attempt at writing a software library from scratch. I had a bunch of code in different places that performed many of the same tasks and wanted to unify it under one framework. It implemented the Data-Consistent Inversion framework (before it was called that), namely our sample-based approach for inverting probability measures.
This was an excellent opportunity to learn the process of writing object-oriented code, unit-tests, and so much more.</description>

      <description>My Brief Experience I was fortunate enough to be funded by Dr. Julien Langou during my summer proceeding entering graduate school. This relief from teaching was especially helpful for my transition into post-graduate education, and I was given the opportunity to explore a number of topics that I knew nothing about.
For the first time, I found myself working on an object-oriented task in a programming language that was strongly typed.</description>

      <description>Overview I received an Undergraduate Fellowship from the Geneseo Foundation to pursue a self-directed research project wherein I would explore the interface of Arts, Mathematics and Computer Science.
 My initial goal was to figure out how to take a still image and turn it into an animation without resorting to frame-by-frame editing.
 Story My mentor introduced me to a professor in the computer science department and we composed a successful proposal for the fellowship program.</description>
