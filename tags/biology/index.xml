      <description>Some Notes from the (co)author I worked on this topic primarily in summer 2014, with occasional contributions into early 2016. There is ample room for extending the work, but ultimately I did not venture into this field for my doctoral research.
I now recognize that we were, however, attempting to answer an inverse problem in this paper and managed to get a glimpse of the solution by solving many forward problems, holding certain parameters fixed.</description>
