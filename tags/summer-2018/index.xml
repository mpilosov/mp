      <description>Program The summer school was focused on Uncertainty Quantification, specifically pretending to Inverse Problems.
Structure We sat through hours of lecture and about half the days we managed to spend programming/implementing some of what we learned.
Project At the end of the summer school we had to perform a project, and I paired up with a couple of students to work on an inverse problem involving the Helmholtz equation.</description>

      <description>This was my first attempt at writing a software library from scratch. I had a bunch of code in different places that performed many of the same tasks and wanted to unify it under one framework. It implemented the Data-Consistent Inversion framework (before it was called that), namely our sample-based approach for inverting probability measures.
This was an excellent opportunity to learn the process of writing object-oriented code, unit-tests, and so much more.</description>
