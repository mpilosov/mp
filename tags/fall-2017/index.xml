      <description>Please pardon our mess.   This page is still a work in progress.   I have many projects that I am documenting simultaneously and am doing my best to be thorough and embed a lot of rich metadata so that you can click around based on what you find interesting.  Please feel free to contact me if you want me to finish this particular page immediately.</description>

      <description>The following is an edited version of an end-of-year summary report sent to the SIAM.
SIAM and Math Club have established three core pillars upon which to form themselves within the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at CU Denver:
 service, scholarship, and community engagement.  In addressing service, we have regularly facilitated participation in regional science fairs, organized a semesterly food bank drive to benefit homeless students on campus (Note: our department was the most successful donor on campus last semester), and have begun to integrate charitable fundraising into our community events.</description>

      <description>I decided to explore the use of Twitter&amp;rsquo;s API in Python to perform some fun projects.
I wrote a Twitter bot called &amp;ldquo;Random Art Baby&amp;rdquo; that when prompted, would respond to users with artwork.
This art was randomly generated using the library I had developed for my initial exploration with graphical user interfaces for visualizing probability distributions.
This also provided me the opportunity to explore some machine learning code for the generation of natural language speech based on training examples.</description>

      <title>DCI</title>

      <description>The novel framework for solving inverse problems in which all of my doctoral work has been grounded.
In the broadest terms possible, Data-Consistent Inversion (DCI) is a new approach to answer questions about the conditions under which observations can occur.
What makes it particularly special is that in a sense, this approach leverages the &amp;ldquo;best of both worlds&amp;rdquo; in the statistical inference world. The two schools of thought: Deterministic Optimization and Bayesian Statistics have different philosophical frameworks for answering questions pertaining to the explanation of observed data.</description>

      <description>Slamming one of the servers when no one else was using it.   Overview I went to work with Dr. Velimir Vesselinov in the summer of 2017 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). This experience drastically changed the direction of my research. I spent much of my time reading papers on Bayesian Inverse Problems and Subsurface Contaminant Transport Problems. Part of what I did was learn the Julia programming language1, implementing some Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to practice, and converting some algorithms from Python to Julia.</description>

      <title>Consistent Bayes</title>

      <description>This was my first attempt at writing a software library from scratch. I had a bunch of code in different places that performed many of the same tasks and wanted to unify it under one framework. It implemented the Data-Consistent Inversion framework (before it was called that), namely our sample-based approach for inverting probability measures.
This was an excellent opportunity to learn the process of writing object-oriented code, unit-tests, and so much more.</description>

      <title>Mentor Lunch</title>

      <description>As President of SIAM, I organized a regular mentor lunch that we started to run every semester. What motivated me was noticing that undergraduates with whom I spoke were routinely unaware of their career options. It was completely unclear what courses they should take because they had a hard time connecting what they liked to possible career paths. Many did not know that graduate school could be paid for! The course descriptions were not particularly helpful since they contained jargon that was unfamiliar to students.</description>
