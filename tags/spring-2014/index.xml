      <description>This was a self-directed research project that had its origins in my desire to better understand the contents of an enticing TED talk that I watched during the first week of my last semester as an undergraduate student.
  What grabbed my attention was that the speaker (Stein) invited scrutiny of their source code, making it [publicly available on GitHub][code]. This event likely seeded my interest in open-source philosophies and diving into this project was an early attempt to learn more about how other people write code.</description>

      <description>After my first experience with writing software in the summer of 2013, I wanted to learn how to write software that was usable by other people1.
I thought that learning how graphical user interfaces work would be a good place to start. Since I already knew Matlab, I chose that for my programming language.
I performed the project under the direction of use of Dr. Yusuf Bilgic, who generally gave me free rein to pursue the project in any direction.</description>

      <description>Summary Along with some good friends, I helped re-establish this defunct club and secure funding for club meetings and events.
My primary responsibilities included all publicity operations and planning the charity fundraisers.
We held weekly meetings and grew from two tables to as many as twelve simultaneous games happening. Snacks were provided and occasionally we were able to provide pizza.
  Waiting for announcements to end so chess can start.</description>

      <description>Four years of active participation in a Service Organization. Almost countless events.
I joined my first semester in undergrad, and remained an active member every semester that I was enrolled in college.
Pillars of the Organization  Scholarship Service Unity Fitness Loyalty   Here is a reproduction of a Lamron Article about the organization. It was written the semester I joined! 
 Men of Action and Change, an organization founded at Geneseo in 1997, is a multicultural group dedicated to continuing a legacy of service and support to the local and global communities.</description>
