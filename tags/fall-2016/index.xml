      <description>The following is an edited version of an end-of-year summary report sent to the SIAM.
SIAM and Math Club have established three core pillars upon which to form themselves within the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at CU Denver:
 service, scholarship, and community engagement.  In addressing service, we have regularly facilitated participation in regional science fairs, organized a semesterly food bank drive to benefit homeless students on campus (Note: our department was the most successful donor on campus last semester), and have begun to integrate charitable fundraising into our community events.</description>

      <description>Summary My advisor developed a framework for solving a large class of problems of particular interest to the engineering disciplines. Starting as a graduate research assistant under his direction in the summer of 2015, I began to learn about this new method and explore implications of how measurements of physical systems are taken on our ability to accurately describe parameter uncertainty sets.
You can read more about it below, but overall, my focus on skewness ended up playing a less important role when we developed a sample-based approach to solving the same problems.</description>

      <description>Math Club began to host regular movie nights each semester, highlighting films about mathematicians. We hoped to reach a broader audience outside the math department by hosting these events in very public locations with generous catering budgets.

      <title>Mentor Lunch</title>

      <description>As President of SIAM, I organized a regular mentor lunch that we started to run every semester. What motivated me was noticing that undergraduates with whom I spoke were routinely unaware of their career options. It was completely unclear what courses they should take because they had a hard time connecting what they liked to possible career paths. Many did not know that graduate school could be paid for! The course descriptions were not particularly helpful since they contained jargon that was unfamiliar to students.</description>

      <description>Billiards night was one of the first events that Christina and I plan for Math Club. It was a relatively simple event, focused on bringing together people For a night of pool and pizza. We played videos about billiards, including ones that went over the geometry of planning different types of shots on televisions in the background of the pool hall. We held this event several times over the years.</description>

      <description>Summary During the last semester of my first year in graduate school (spring 2015), I volunteered for the Study Hall that was being put on by the department. I was inspired by that event to get in touch with the professor who organized it, and asked about interest in a Math Club. I was told that it had languished over the years but I was welcome to revive it (he was willing to be the faculty advisor), and he put me in touch with an undergraduate student that he thought would be good to partner up with.</description>

      <description>This student conference brings together students from a number of universities in the Rocky Mountain Region to give presentations in an intimate environment. I have been involved in some way or another in its organization for all my years at CU Denver.
As President I helped change the way we secure funding for the event and increased our budget for food by working out an agreement with our student government association to co-sponsor the event.</description>
