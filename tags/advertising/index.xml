      <description>I have been advertising events hosted by SIAM for several years now as part of my dedication to service to my graduate department at CU Denver. One thing I consistently struggled with was finding high-quality versions of the SIAM logo for use in the posters I was making.
I still do not understand why their website assets are consistently ranked as irrelevant on Google image search For the longest time I was pulling images from other people&amp;rsquo;s websites that Google was scraping more successfully.</description>
