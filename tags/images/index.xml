      <description>After my first experience with writing software in the summer of 2013, I wanted to learn how to write software that was usable by other people1.
I thought that learning how graphical user interfaces work would be a good place to start. Since I already knew Matlab, I chose that for my programming language.
I performed the project under the direction of use of Dr. Yusuf Bilgic, who generally gave me free rein to pursue the project in any direction.</description>

      <description>Overview I received an Undergraduate Fellowship from the Geneseo Foundation to pursue a self-directed research project wherein I would explore the interface of Arts, Mathematics and Computer Science.
 My initial goal was to figure out how to take a still image and turn it into an animation without resorting to frame-by-frame editing.
 Story My mentor introduced me to a professor in the computer science department and we composed a successful proposal for the fellowship program.</description>
